# Matrix Mixer design written in Pure Data vanilla

All parameters are audio rate modulatable. There is a 5x5 example matrix included with a basic sound source to be able to test the mixer: function-matrix~.pd

Inspiration and original analogue hardware design "Pluck and Duck" by NoizeHardware / Minijack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0PYuuFQw4

I hope this to be turned into an analog hardware soon!

### Example 5x5 Matrix:

![function-matrix~.pd](/../screenshots/screenshots/function-matrix~.png?raw=true "function-matrix~.pd")

### Connect as many nodes as your CPU like:

![function-matrix~.pd](/../screenshots/screenshots/function-matrix~2.png?raw=true "function-matrix~.pd")

### Single Node:

![pluck-and-duck~.pd](/../screenshots/screenshots/pluck-and-duck~.png?raw=true "pluck-and-duck~.pd")

### Main signal flow:

![main-signal-flow.pd](/../screenshots/screenshots/main-signal-flow.png?raw=true "main-signal-flow.pd")

### Core module:

![pluck-and-duck-core~.pd](/../screenshots/screenshots/pluck-and-duck-core~.png?raw=true "pluck-and-duck-core~.pd")
